## Teaching Biography

**Andrew Selzer** (he/him) began swing dancing and teaching at The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) Swing Dance Club. A native of Southern California, Andrew had a unique swing dance upbringing, learning and dancing on both coasts of the United States. Today, he is the owner and director of [Boston Lindy Hop](https://bostonlindyhop.com), a Lindy Hop and Vernacular Jazz school based in Boston where he continues to teach.

With nearly 15 years of teaching experience—from drop-in classes and weekly series to weekend workshops—Andrew brings a wealth of knowledge and a global perspective to the classroom. He has danced around the world, drawing inspiration from a diverse range of teachers, styles, and communities.

As a teacher, Andrew focuses on three key priorities: partnership, musicality, and self-expression. Outside the classroom, he has had the honor of performing as a dancer with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band and plays clarinet with [River Street Six](https://www.instagram.com/riverstreetsix/), deepening his understanding of the music that drives the dance.
