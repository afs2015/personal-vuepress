# About

## Teaching Biography

Andrew Selzer (he/him) began swing dancing and teaching at The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) Swing Dance Club. A native of Southern California, Andrew had a unique swing dance upbringing, learning and dancing on both coasts of the United States. These days he is the owner and director of [Boston Lindy Hop](https://bostonlindyhop.com), a Lindy Hop and Vernacular Jazz school based in Boston where he continues to teach.

He has almost 15 years of teaching experience between weekly series classes and weekend workshops. In addition, he has had the privilege of dancing around the world and those experiences have provided him with a smorgasbord of influences to draw upon in a classroom&nbsp;setting.

When it comes to teaching, Andrew has three priorities: partnership, musicality, and self-expression. In addition to his dance experience, he also plays clarinet in the jazz band, the [River Street Six](https://www.instagram.com/riverstreetsix/).
